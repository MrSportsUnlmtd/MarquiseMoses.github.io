  Hey, my name is Marquise, I am a Senior at EWU, studying exercise science and public relations with a minor in nutrition. I currently play rugby and basketball, and I am a former football player. I have a 2 year old little girl who was the bay on the tv show "Arrow". I model and act in my spare time when I can get away from school.
