<h2 id="link1">Bio</h2>
           
<p1>Hey, my name is Marquise, I am a Senior at EWU, studying exercise science and public relations with a minor in nutrition. I currently play rugby for EWU, I'm a former football player for the college also, and in my spare time I love to workout and play basketball. I have a 2 year old daughter who's name is Arianna, she had the opportunity at such a young age to play the baby on the tv show "Arrow" and it was such an amazing experince to be a part of. I am also a fitness model, have done a lot of work for Nike out of Portland, Oregon. It's been quite the journey getting to travel and meet/work with such amazing people. I also act in my spare time, I am signed with 2 agencies, one located in Spokane, and the other located in Portland. I have been very blessed to be able to do stuff like this, and it's been even more amazing to see my little girl following in my footsteps.

      <h3>Denver Broncos</h3>
      My most favorite team in the NFL. Winners of superbowl 50 with one of the most dominant defenses the league has seen. It all started with Madden 95 and seeing Terrell Davis tear up defenses with his dominant running.

      <h3>Oregon Ducks</h3>
      My favorite college football team. They have the most amazing, most speedy running backs most schools could only dream of. Their offense is electric and scary. One of the dream schools I wish I could have went to.

      <h3>Arrow</h3>
      The TV show my little baby girl appeared on from the age of 3 months to 2 years old. It was an amazing experience getting to meet the famous actors, and for her to get that kind of expereince at such a young age.

      <h3>Ballroom Dancing</h3>
      A skill I acquired in my early 20's, I was a ballroom dance instructor. Was a very fun time getting to learn and teach such a skill that takes lots of practice. Rumba, salsa, waltz, fox-trot, cha-cha, such fun dances.

      <h3>Dodge Raptor</h3>
      My dream vehicle that I plan on getting after I graduate college in the spring of 2018. So much muscle, so much power, and of course it's just an overall gorgeous truck, with the Matte finish, there is no such thing as going wrong with this vehicle.

      <h3>Rugby</h3>
      A new sport I decided to try out during my remaining college years, my version of football. This has been a very fun sport to play, something I never would have thought about trying growing up, but it has become something important in my life keeping me active.
